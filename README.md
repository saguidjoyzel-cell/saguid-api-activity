# RESTful API Activity - Joyzel H. Saguid
# Best Practices Implementation
# 1. Environment Variables
# Why did we put BASE_URI in .env instead of hardcoding it?
Answer: To keep config secure and flexible across environments.

# 2. Resource Modeling
# Why did we use plural nouns (e.g., /dishes) for our routes?
Answer: Because it follows REST conventions and clearly represents collections.

# 3. Status Codes
# When do we use 201 Created vs 200 OK?
Answer: 201 when a new resource is successfully added, 200 when a resource is retrieved, updated, or deleted.

# Why is it important to return 404 instead of just an empty array or a generic error?
Answer: It communicates that the resource doesn’t exist and avoids confusion with empty results.
